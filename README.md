# ODE Solver

[https://tamjidfahim02.pythonanywhere.com/#documentation]

## Description

This web application is designed to solve non-homogeneous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) conveniently. Users can input the order of the ODE, specify coefficients, define the right-hand side of the equation, and even provide initial conditions for a complete solution.

## Features

- **Symbolic ODE Solving**: Utilizes the SymPy library for symbolic ODE solving.
- **Initial Conditions**: Allows users to provide initial conditions for specific derivatives.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive web interface for entering ODE parameters.
- **Export Solutions**: Provides solutions in a readable format for easy analysis and use.
